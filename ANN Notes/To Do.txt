To do:
CNN:
- visualize training/test accuracy vs. epoch
- visualize weights vs. training epoch
- lump weights together in vector, spaghetti plot
- look at weights at the end
- add regularization (dropout, L2), dropout module in pytorch
- try with different learning rates
- research learning rate/dropping out/training NN
- cross-validation training (folds, helps improve generalization)

Signal Processing:
- reduce number of input parameters
- look at energy for each channel over 5s trial
