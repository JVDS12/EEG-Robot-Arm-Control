Shallow CNN Model

-mimics FBCSP (Filter Bank Common Spatial Patterns)

-specifically tailored to decode band power features
-the first two layers perform a temporal convolution and a spatial filter
	-analogous to the bandpass and CSP spatial filter steps in FBCSP
-temporal convolution had a larger kernel size (25)
	-allowed larger range of transformations in this layer
-next layers: squaring nonlinearity, mean pooling layer, logarithmic activation function
	-analogous to the trial log-variance computation in FBCSP
-embeds all the computational steps in a single network
	-all steps can be optimized jointly
-several pooling regions within one trial
	-can learn a temporal structure of the band power changes within the trial


	FBCSP
-convolution measures shared energy between filter and time series
-fit filter to each spatial pattern a number of time and computing average, make a bank of. These and convolve them
