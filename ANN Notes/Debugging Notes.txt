EEG Issues

OpenBCI GUI: - freezes randomly
	     - major spikes across all channels randomly

CNN: - line 180 ERROR index out of range
	- receiving msg from gui to send feedback before getting newest data from stream
	- added time delay before sending msg from gui2cnn
	- works for smaller experiments (10-100 trials) but breaks on longer (260 trials)
     - trains quickly, tweak hyperparameters, not better than chance yet


- temporarily convert bandpass to highpass (or make highcut arbitrarily high, 1 billion)
- try shake vs. no shake trials (do two trials and plot both of them)
- make a faraday cage (wrap headset in aluminum foil, put box wrapped in aluminum foil on headset over headset)
- 10-20 trials, see if CNN can classify
