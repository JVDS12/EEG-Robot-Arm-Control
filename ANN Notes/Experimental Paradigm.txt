EXPERIMENTAL PARADIGM

Trial Setup
- trial direction/order randomized
- Initial Training
	- 2s of blank screen (black)
	- 2s of fixation cross (green)
	- Xs of cue/direction arrow (red)
		- X in 2s increments depending on desired trial length

- Additional Training w/ Feedback
	- 2s of blank screen (black)
	- 2s of fixation cross (green)
	- Xs of cue/direction arrow (red)
		- X same duration set in initial training
	- 10s of feedback arrow (blue)
		- 2s per feedback based on previous 2s chunk of EEG
		- CNN outputs preditcion (arrow direction) & confidence (arrow length)

- Testing w/ Feedback
	- 2s of blank screen (black)
	- 2s of fixation cross (green)
	- Xs of cue/direction arrow (red)
		- X same duration set in initial training
	- 8s of feedback arrow (blue)
		- 2s per feedback based on previous 2s chunk of EEG
		- CNN outputs preditcion (arrow direction) & confidence (arrow length)
		- prediction on last 2s chunk used as class label for trial
		- testing accuracy calculated using test trial predictions
		  and actual classes

Stream EEG
- raw data sampled at 250Hz
- collected in 2s chunks (500 samples)
	- collection starts 500ms before cue presentation
	- ends after trial completed (Xs)
- each 2s chunk is assigned class label, filtered, and sent to CNN script
	- 60Hz notch filter
	- butterworth bandpass filter (filtfilt- front/back) 0.5-100Hz

CNN
- data collected and stored
- once initial trials completed, CNN trained
- after completion, additional training trials initiated
	- each trial is fed into CNN and an output is predicted
	- prediction turned into visual feedback (arrow direction) with 
	  confidence (arrow length)
- after additional training trials are finished, CNN trained again to
  incorporate new data
- testing trials are initialized w/ finalized CNN
	- visual feedback given for 2s chunks of EEG data
