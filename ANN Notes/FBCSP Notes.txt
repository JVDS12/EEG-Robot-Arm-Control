Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP)

- addresses the problem of selecting an appropriate operational frequency band for extracting discriminating CSP features

- FBCSP employs a feature selection algorithm to select discriminative CSP features from a bank of
  multiple bandpass filters and spatial filters, and a classification algorithm to classify the selected features

- capable of learning subject-specific patterns from the high-dimensional EEG measurements without operator intervention

- Each pair of bandpass and spatial filter yields CSP features that are specific
  to the frequency range of the bandpass filter

- CSP calculates spatial filters for detecting ERD & ERS (Event Related De/Synchronization)
	- ERD/S: attenuation or increase of localized neural rhythmic activity (results from MI tasks)
	- compute features whose variances are optimal for discriminating two classes of EEG measurements

- Highly generalizable as any feature selection and classification algorithms from the machine learning
  and computational intelligence literature can be employed

4 Main Stages of FBCSP:
	1. Frequency filtering
		- EEG is bandpass-filtered into multiple frequency bands using
		  zero-phase Chebyshev Type II Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters
		- Zero-phase filtering used to overcome non-linear phase shift caused by IIR filter
		- IIR filter arises from linear time-invarient systems,
		  impulse point does NOT become exactly zero past a certain point
	2. Spatial filtering
		- CSP features are extracted from each band
	3. Feature selection
		- Feature selection algorithm is used to automatically select
		  discriminative paris of frequency bands & corresponding CSP features
	4. Classification
		- Classification algorithm is used to classify CSP features

2 Main Feature Extraction Approaches:
	1. Wrapper
		- features are selected using the classifier
		- typically yields better performance
		- increased computational effort
	2. Filter
		- features are selected independent from the classifier
